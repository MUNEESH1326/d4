# Day 4 - Signal Processing
Scenario: Finally, you're starting to validate the main feature of Dawnstar's FIR Filter IP: Signal processing.

## Assignment instructions
You only need to validate chip unit 0 today, represented by `impl0`. 

You are also given:
- 4 configuration files: `p0.cfg`, `p4.cfg`, `p7.cfg`, `p9.cfg`
- Vector to be filtered by the FIR filter, `square.vec`

Set the filter's coefficients based on the 4 configuration files and drive its input signal using the vector file containing the values of the input signals. 

## Submitting the assignment
This assignment doesn't have an autograder and will be graded manually. 

Once you are done, don't forget to submit by updating `filter-initial.py`.
